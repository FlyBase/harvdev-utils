        Process the synonym_name given and check for organism specific stuff
        and report back organism as well as the plain text and sgml versions.

        if synonym has '\' in it the split and use first bit as the species abbreviation
        Also check for species starting with T: as this is some special shit.

    Args:
        session (sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session object): db connection to use.

        synonym_name (str): synonym name to be processed.
